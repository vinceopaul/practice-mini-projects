  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This Filipino beef giniling stew is one of my favorite comfort foods. My way of making it is pretty easy and
    doesn't take too long. Serve with white rice.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups water, divided, or more as needed</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 medium red potatoes, cubed</li>
    <li>10 baby carrots, or more to taste, cubed</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
    <li>½ cup raisins, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce with salt</li>
    <li>½ medium orange bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add beef and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper
      and add more water as needed; do not let beef dry out.</li>
    <li>Add potatoes, carrots, and 3 tablespoons soy sauce; cook for 4 minutes, adding more water if mixture is too dry.
      Add raisins and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, again adding water as needed.</li>
    <li>Pour in one can tomato sauce. Fill the can with water and swirl to remove excess sauce; pour into the saucepan.
      Stir in remaining 1/2 can sauce until combined. Add more water as needed to create a saucy but not soupy
      consistency.</li>
    <li>Stir in bell pepper, sugar, and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally and adding water
      as needed so sauce does not dry out, until all vegetables are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
